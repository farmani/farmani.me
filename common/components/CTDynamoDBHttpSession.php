/**
 * CCacheHttpSession implements a session component using cache as storage medium.
 *
 * The cache being used can be any cache application component implementing {@link ICache} interface.
 * The ID of the cache application component is specified via {@link cacheID}, which defaults to 'cache'.
 *
 * Beware, by definition cache storage are volatile, which means the data stored on them
 * may be swapped out and get lost. Therefore, you must make sure the cache used by this component
 * is NOT volatile. If you want to use {@link CDbCache} as storage medium, use {@link CDbHttpSession}
 * is a better choice.
 *
 * @property boolean $useCustomStorage Whether to use custom storage.
